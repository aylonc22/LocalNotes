# LocalNotes 📝

**LocalNotes** is a serverless note-taking app built entirely on **LocalStack**, simulating AWS services locally. It's designed as a learning project to explore AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and local CI/CD — without incurring cloud costs.

---

## 🌟 Features

- Serverless backend (Lambda + API Gateway)
- Notes stored in DynamoDB (via LocalStack)
- Clean React frontend (Vite + Fetch API)
- Fully local development workflow
- Optional GitHub Actions for CI testing

## 🔧 Technologies Used

| Service     | Local Simulation | Purpose               |
|------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Lambda      | LocalStack       | Serverless logic (note APIs) |
| API Gateway | LocalStack       | RESTful API endpoint   |
| DynamoDB    | LocalStack       | NoSQL storage for notes |
| S3          | (Optional)       | Attachments or backups |

### 2. Clone and Boot

```
git clone https://github.com/aylonc22/LocalNotes.git
cd localnotes
docker-compose up -d  # starts LocalStack
```
3. Deploy Backend
Using Serverless Framework (with localstack plugin):
```
cd backend
npm install
sls deploy --stage local
```
4. Start Frontend
```
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Access the app at http://localhost:5173.

## 🧪 CI/CD (Optional)
A GitHub Actions workflow is included to simulate deployment and run tests locally.

## 🧠 Learning Goals
